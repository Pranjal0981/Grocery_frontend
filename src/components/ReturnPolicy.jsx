                    At RGS India Group Grocery, we are committed to ensuring transparency and trust with our customers.
                    To uphold this commitment, we offer an "Open Box Delivery" policy.

                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                    With our Open Box Delivery policy, customers have the option to inspect their order upon delivery before accepting it.
                    This allows customers to verify the contents of their order and ensure its quality and accuracy before final acceptance.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                    Once the customer accepts the delivery, the order is considered complete, and no returns or exchanges will be accepted, except in cases where the product is damaged or defective upon inspection.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                    If you receive a damaged or defective product during the Open Box inspection, please contact our customer support team immediately with clear photos of the issue.
                    We will assess the situation and provide a suitable solution, which may include a refund or replacement of the damaged item.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg">
                    We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in adhering to our Open Box Delivery policy as we strive to maintain transparency and satisfaction for our valued customers.
